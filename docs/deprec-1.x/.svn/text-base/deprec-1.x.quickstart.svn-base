== deprec quickstart (with svn, trac and deployment to apache/mongrel/mysql)

Here are instructions that will take a fresh install of Ubuntu Dapper (6.06.1 server), create a working rails app, create an SVN repository and trac installation for it and deploy it using apache, mongrel and mysql.

All commands below are run on your local host. You will *never* be requested 
to log into the remote server manually. Capistrano does all the work.
