== 1.99.24 (July  7, 2008)

* I've rejigged things to make it easier to install a service without having
  a local config directory. For example:

  cap deprec:nginx:install HOSTS=192.168.0.10  

  This will download and compile nginx, and push out a config file without 
  generating a local copy. You don't need a config/ dir and you don't need 
  to have defined a :web role.

  Meta-tasks (like deprec:rails:install_stack) can now pass a block of commands 
  to with_roles(roles).

  config_gen and config are still available but it's now possible to install 
  a rails stack without generating any local files. 

== 1.99.21 (June 17, 2008)

* added recipes and config templates for ar_sendmail
* added gitosis support
* added deprec:xen:migrate for "manually" moving slice between hosts

== 1.99.20 (June 3, 2008)

* added git support: install git, manage ssh users and create remote repositories

== 1.99.19 (June 3, 2008)

* feature: added logrotate. configs generated for nginx and mongrel
* bugfix: monit:install was calling monit:activate but this won't work will monit:config is called. 

== 1.99.18 (May  28, 2008)

* bugfix: nagios config option was not being set till after required

== 1.99.17 (May  22, 2008)

* monit config for mongrel now lives under config/mongrel instead of config/monit
  This way, monit configs for services can live with the recipes/templates for that service.

== 1.99.16 (May  5, 2008)

* change: start mongrel using mongrel_cluster with --clean option so mongrel 
  will start even when there are stale pids around.

* bugfix: nginx vhost template now uses :mongrel_port instead of 8000


== 1.99.15 (Mar 27, 2008)

== 1.99.14 (Feb 21, 2008)

== 1.99.5 (Feb 12, 2008)

* feature: installs and configures monit to manage your mongrel processes [Mike Bailey]

* feature: When running config_gen,  if deprec discovers a file exists, checks 
           whether the new file differs from the existing one. If they're 
           identical, it skips it.

		   If they differ, the user is presented with the options to overwrite 
		   or not but now there's an extra option to view a diff of the changes 
		   that would occur. [Mike Bailey]

* change:  handle_command_with_input now accepts an optional response parameter.
           This is useful if you need to change a password on many servers and 
           don't want to have to keep entering the password at the prompt for
           each box. [Mike Bailey]

== 1.99.4 (Feb 11, 2008)

* Bugfix: set correct path to templates [Mike Bailey]
