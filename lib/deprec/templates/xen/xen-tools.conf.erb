#  Output directory for storing loopback images.
#
#  If you choose to use loopback images, which are simple to manage but
# slower than LVM partitions, then specify a directory here and uncomment
# the line.
#
#  New instances will be stored in subdirectories named after their
# hostnames.
# 
##
# dir = /home/xen
# dir = /var/vm
#

#
##
#
# If you don't wish to use loopback images then you may specify an 
# LVM volume group here instead
#
##
# lvm = skx-vg
lvm = vm_local

##
#
#  Installation method.
#
#  There are four distinct methods which you may to install a new copy
# of Linux to use in your Xen guest domain:
#
#   - Installation via the debootstrap command.
#   - Installation via the rpmstrap command.
#   - Installation by copying a directory containing a previous installation.
#   - Installation by untarring a previously archived image.
#
#  NOTE That if you use the "untar", or "copy" options you should ensure
# that the image you're left with matches the 'dist' setting later in
# this file.
#
#
##
#
# 
# install-method = [ debootstrap | rpmstrap | copy | tar ]
#
#
install-method = debootstrap

#
# If you're using "copy", or "tar" you will need to specify the
# source location to copy from, or the source .tar file to unpack.
#
# You may specify that with a line such as:
#
# install-source = /path/to/copy
# install-source = /some/path/img.tar
#
#

#
##
#  Command definitions.
##
#
# The "debootstrap" and "rpmstrap" commands are hardwired into the
# script, but if you wish to modify the commands which are executed
# when installing new systems by a "copy" or "tar" method you can
# do so here:
#
# install-method=copy:
# copy-cmd = /bin/cp -a $src/* $dest
#
# install-method=tar:
# tar-cmd  = /bin/tar --numeric-owner -xvf $src
#
#



#
##
#  Disk and Sizing options.
##
#
size   = 10Gb     # Disk image size.
memory = 256Mb    # Memory size
swap   = 512Mb    # Swap size
# noswap = 1      # Don't use swap at all for the new system.
fs     = ext3     # use the EXT3 filesystem for the disk image.
dist   = gutsy    # Default distribution to install.
image  = full     # Specify sparse vs. full disk images.

#
#  Currently supported and tested distributions include:
#
#   sid          - Debian
#   sarge        - Debian
#   etch         - Debian
#   dapper       - Ubuntu
#   centos4      - CentOS 4
#   fedora-core4 - Fedora Core 4 (codname stentz)

# Networking setup values.

#
# Uncomment and adjust these network settings if you wish to give your
# new instances static IP addresses.
#
gateway   = 192.168.1.1
netmask   = 255.255.255.0
broadcast = 192.168.1.255

# Uncomment this if you wish the images to use DHCP

##
# Misc options
##

#
# Uncomment the following line if you wish to disable the caching
# of downloaded .deb files when using debootstrap to install images.
#
# cache = no
#

#
# Uncomment the following line if you wish to interactively setup
# a new root password for images.
#
passwd = 1

#
# If you'd like all accounts on your host system which are not present
# on the guest system to be copied over then uncomment the following line.
#
# accounts = 1
#

#
# Default kernel and ramdisk to use for the virtual servers
#
kernel      = /boot/vmlinuz-`uname -r`
initrd      = /boot/initrd.img-`uname -r`

#
#  The architecture to use when using debootstrap or rpmstrap.
#
#  This is most useful on 64 bit host machines, for other systems it
# doesn't need to be used.
#
# arch=i386
#

#
# The default mirror for debootstrap to install Debian-derived distributions
#
# mirror = http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/

#
# A mirror suitable for use when installing the Dapper release of Ubuntu.
#
# mirror = http://gb.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/

#
#  If you like you could use per-distribution mirrors, which will
# be more useful if you're working in an environment where you want
# to regularly use multiple distributions:
#
# mirror_sid=http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian
# mirror_sarge=http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian
# mirror_etch=http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian
# mirror_dapper=http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu
# mirror_edgy=http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu
# mirror_feisty=http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu
mirror_gutsy=http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu


#
#  Uncomment if you wish newly created images to boot once they've been
# created.
#
# boot = 1
#

#  If you're using a newer version of the Xen guest kernel you will
# need to make sure that you use 'xvc0' for the guest serial device,
# and 'xvdX' instead of 'sdX' for serial devices.
#
# serial_device = tty1 #default
# serial_device = xvc0
#
# disk_device = sda  #default
# disk_device = xvda
